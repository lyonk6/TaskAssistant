1. Presently, no API can indicate what an added object's new id is. The repository 
"add(Object)" function ought to return the new object, and this must be done for 
all of the APIs. 

2. Handling Update calls to the API:

*** Option 1. Updates to any object must:
 1. Verify that the new state is valid. 
    a. Verify objects being referenced exist.
    b. Verify privleges when necessary.
 2. Make changes to the existing state.


*** Option 2. Updates to any object must:
 1. Start with a deep copy of each object in qustion.
    a. Implement return a deep copy ObjectRepository.get(Object)
    b. 
 3. Verify that the new state is valid by creating this new state.
 4. Commit changes to the new state.
