1. Presently, no API can indicate what an added object's new id is. The repository 
"add(Object)" function ought to return the new object, and this must be done for 
all of the APIs. 

2. All model objects must implement an addObject(Object) method that ensures that
no a given reference cannot be placed in the Array of IDs more than once.

3. Presently it is not possible to move a Task from one TaskList to another.

4. When a Task is updated, and no field of category IDs is specified, then the 
Task does not update the Category IDs. Should it set those categories to null?
