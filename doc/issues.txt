0.  The permissions verification is broken. This needs to be fixed see the methods:
    verifySchedulePrivileges and verifyCategoryPrivileges in the AuthRequestHandler 
    class.
    
1.  Presently, no API can indicate what an added object's new id is. The repository
    "add(Object)" function ought to return the new object, and this must be done for 
    all of the APIs. 
    
2.  All model objects must implement an addObject(Object) method that ensures that a 
    given reference cannot be placed in the Array of IDs more than once. This needs 
    to be tested by the model unit tests as well.
    
3.  Presently it is not possible to move a Task from one TaskList to another.

4.  Updates ought to have a clean-up method similar those present in Add APIs. It 
    should update the repository with the serverObjects used to to map all of the
    objects that need to be cleaned and modified.
    
5.  Most unit tests do not test the point back error where an inconsistency in the 
    database is not detected because the API assumes the internal data is never
    corrupted.
    
6.  Database sanitization. When someone creates a "note" or names a task, how do we 
    make sure the database is not corrupted?

7.  I would like to see a UI where TaskLists are generated on the fly. This way a 
    person can create a task list by selecting and de-selecting categories. Such a 
    TaskList should be called a "todo" list? At present, this api does not really 
    support that.

8.  Does the DeleteTaskList class clean existing reminders?

9.  The new time stamp format does not automatically throw exceptions for malformed
    dates. A routine for verifying dates needs to be added to each API.

10. Objects should not implement ArrayLists of other object Ids, they should be List
    objects instead.

11. Enum type errors are not caught by Gson.
     
12. Boolean errors arn't caught either.
     
13. Objects that need names no longer errors when a null value is given.

14. Number format exceptions are also missed.

Mike likes a program called: http://todotxt.com/

Also, mike says that if something is low priority, but is really short, then the cost 
of keeping it on the task list is too expensive to just leave in the task list. 
Alternatively: if the cost of making a decission is more than the difference between 
decisions, then jsut flip a coin.

*** Security ***
Use "O"-auth to protect all of out APIs. There exists a philosophy that all get 
requests are open, and everything else ought to be behind a token. This probably 
sucks for our purposes however.

Logins require user name and password. The response is a token, and tokens are 
required for all post, get, delete and put requests.
