1. Presently, no API can indicate what an added object's new id is. The repository
   "add(Object)" function ought to return the new object, and this must be done for 
   all of the APIs. 

2. All model objects must implement an addObject(Object) method that ensures that
   a given reference cannot be placed in the Array of IDs more than once. This 
   needs to be tested by the model unit tests as well.

3. Presently it is not possible to move a Task from one TaskList to another.

4. Updates ought to have a clean-up method similar those present in Add APIs. It 
   should update the repository with the serverObjects used to to map all of the
   objects that need to be cleaned and modified.

5. Most unit tests do not test the point back error where an inconsistency in the 
   database is not detected because the API assumes the internal data is never
   corrupted.

6. Database sanitization. When someone creates a "note" or names a task, how do we 
   make sure the database is not corrupted?

7.  I would like to see a UI where TaskLists are generated on the fly. This way a 
    person can create a task list by selecting and de-selecting categories. Such a 
    TaskList should be called a "todo" list? At present, this api does not really 
    support that.

Also, mike says that if something is low priority, but is really short, then
the cost of keeping it on the task list is too expensive to just leave in the
task list. Alternatively: if the cost of making a decission is more than the 
difference between decisions, then jsut flip a coin.

*** Security ***
Use "O"-auth to protect all of out APIs. There exists a philosophy that all get
requests are open, and everything else ought to be behind a token. This probably
sucks for our purposes however.

Logins require user name and password. The response is a token, and tokens 
are required for all post, get, delete and put requests.

NEW PROBLEMS (AS OF 09/11/2016):
1. Do not attempt to parse Strings as Integers, JSON can do this w/o my help.
2. Objects should not implement ArrayLists of other object Ids, they should be List
objects instead.
