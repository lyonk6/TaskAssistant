1. Make exception classes serializable.
2. Refactor the Reminder api. Should Reminder be a child of Task? or is it 
   it's own api? Methinks the latter makes sense.
3. Do we need both taskLists and task Categories? Somehow I figured that 
   the taskList would be all tasks that fall within a given category. Or
   maybe not. Should readdress with Mike.
4. Mike and I should revisit the model, and what we want to do with this 
   application. Just to make sure we don't want to change anything right now.
