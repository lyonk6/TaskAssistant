1. The Schedule object sucks. At present it is just a block that optionally
   repeats every day, week, month or year. Methinks something better might 
   exist?
2. Should all model ids be changed to long and throw exceptions for negative 
   numbers? Methinks so.
3. What is the "invested time" Task field for? How is it calculated?
4. What constitutes urgency? And where is it set?
5. Database sanitization. When someone creates a "note" or names a task,
   how do we make sure the database is not corrupted?
6. How do we handle imcomplete objects? A task w/o a due date for example. 
   Should I have to check for null parameters or should Mike always send a 
   default.
7. What are abstract classes. Have Mike expain that shit.
8. It is not clear how TaskLists are going to be used. The API specifies an
   "UpdateTaskList" api field.
9. I would like to see a UI where TaskLists are generated on the fly. This way
   a person can create a task list by selecting and de-selecting categories.
   At present, this api does not really support that.



edge case - some word mike says alot.

Mike likes a program called: http://todotxt.com/

Also, mike says that if something is low priority, but is really short, then
the cost of keeping it on the task list is too expensive to not jsut leave it
on the task list. Alternatively: if the cost of making a dicission is more than
the difference between decisions, then jsut flip a coin.

Use "O"-auth to protect all of out APIs. There exists a philosophy that all get
requests are open, and everything else ought to be behind a token. This probably
sucks for our purposes however.

*** Security ***
Logins require user name and password. The response is a token, and tokens 
are required for all post, get, delete and put requests.
