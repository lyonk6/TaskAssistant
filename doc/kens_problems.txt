1. Make exception classes serializable.
2. Refactor the Reminder api. Should Reminder be a child of Task? or is it 
   it's own api? Methinks the latter makes sense.
3. Do we need both taskLists and task Categories? Somehow I figured that 
   the taskList would be all tasks that fall within a given category. Or
   maybe not. Should readdress with Mike.
4. Mike and I should revisit the model, and what we want to do with this 
   application. Just to make sure we don't want to change anything right now.
5. When updating an existing object, (ie User) should Mike specify what needs
   to be updated in the json String?
6. How about json serilization. Can it really be that easy?
7. Tell mike that I am using gson to serialize these objects.
